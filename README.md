# crownstone-lib-python-sdk
This is a collective top-level repository that contains documentation and examples regarding the available Python libraries.

# Libraries

The Crownstone ecosystem has a number of different aspects. 

- Getting data regarding your Crownstone account is done via de cloud library.
- Getting real-time updates on changes like adding Crownstones, users, rooms etc is done using the SSE library
- Communicating with a Crownstone via Bluetooth is done using the BLE library.
- If you have a Crownstone USB, you need the UART library to talk to it.

# Package management

We use pip to distribute the libraries. You can find those here.

In order to ensure that dependencies do not interfere with eachother you can use Python virtual environments. A full description on how this works can be found here.
